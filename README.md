# mcscatter
Parallel C++ routine for Monte Carlo simulation of Compton scattering and photoelectric absorption of gamma (10 < E < 700) keV ray photons in arbitrary materials and arbitrary geometries.

Includes visualization notebook with examples for analysing the results, including spatial distributions, energy deposition, and spectral modeling.
